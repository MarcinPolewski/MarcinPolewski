## Project-heat-equation
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-heat-equation.git)
### About
This project is a simulation of heat transfer on flat surfaces. Was created as team project for FO(General Science) classes. The heat equation is a differential equation, therefore we had to use numerical methods to solve it. We opted for FTCS and BTCS, where FTCS turned out to be faster an more effective for our applicatoin

### Technologies
- python
