# My projects(from newesest to oldest)
## Project-voice-command-recognition
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-voice-command-recognition.git)
This was a team project created for Golem AI society. Our goal was to implement 2 types of convolutional neural network and any other model to perform a sound clasification. I was responsible for 2D CNN and I managed to achieve 87% accuracy
### Technologies
- pytorch
- python
## Project-heat-equation
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-heat-equation.git)
### About
This project is a simulation of heat transfer on flat surfaces. Was created as team project for FO(General Science) classes. The heat equation is a differential equation, therefore we had to use numerical methods to solve it. We opted for FTCS and BTCS, where FTCS turned out to be faster an more effective for our applicatoin
### Technologies
- python
## Project-flashcards
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-flashcards.git)
### About
Team project created for PAP(application programming) classes. It's a flashcard application with spaced repetition system, folder sharing and other features. From technical point of view it's a 3 layer, conterenised web application
### Technologies:
- backend
  - Java with spring boot
- frontend
  - React(so HTML, CSS and JS)
- database
  - mySQL
- contenerisation
  - docker
## Project-task-manager
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-task-manager.git)
### About 
This solo project was created to practise Java and explore RAD(rapid application developemnt) with JavaFX. My main goal was to apply knowledge learned in spring boot course in real world project. This application allows users to create tasks, schedule them and categorize them into folders
### Technologies
- Java with spring boot
- JavaFX
- mySQL 
## Project-smart-bin
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-smart-bin.git)
### About 
This was a team project, where we had to create a smart bin with a ESP-32 microcontroller. This bin would be connected to internet, so users could view it's state and other things on website. This repository contains our code for database, website and microcontroller. 

I was responsible for programming the microcontroller. The main problem that I encountered was unpredictable results from sensors - for instance we used distance sensor to detect lid opening, but we had to filter it's signal due to many imperfections
### Technologies
- micropython
- vue
- mySQL
## Project-restaurant-pos
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-restaurant-pos.git)
### About 
This is a team project, where we created a POS(point of sales) for restaurants, that allows restaurant owners to easily configure - table positions, menu and other things are confiugred via csv files(in folder memoryHandlerConf). It gives users basic functionality of creating orders, swiching current waiters. Waiter can only see orders that are assigned to him
### Technologies
- nCurses
- CMake
- C++
## Project-battleships
[link to repo](https://github.com/MarcinPolewski/Project-battleships.git)
### About 
It's a simple game of battleships. It has two modes player-vs-player or player-vs-computer.
### Technologies
- python
- pygame
- numpy
### Assembler projects 
This projects listed below find markers on given bitmap. Marker is defined as an letter L with ration between longer and shorter line equal to 2. Size did not matter
